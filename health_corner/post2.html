             <h2>Understanding Diabetes, Symptoms, Causes and Treatment</h2>
            <p class="post-date">Published: [11/05/2025]</p> <img src="images/Diabetes.jpg" alt="A blood sugar test device" style="width: 40%; max-height: 400px; object-fit: cover; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
            <p> Diabetes is a chronic health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy. It occurs when your blood glucose (blood sugar) levels are too high, either because your body doesn’t make enough insulin or cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. With millions of people affected globally, understanding diabetes is key to prevention, early detection, and proper management.</p>

  <h2>Types of Diabetes</h2>
  <p>There are three main types of diabetes:</p>
  <ol>
    <li> <strong>Type 1 Diabetes</strong></li>
      <p>This is an autoimmune condition where the body attacks and destroys the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. It usually develops in children or young adults but can appear at any age. People with Type 1 diabetes must take insulin daily.</p>
    <li><strong>Type 2 Diabetes</strong></li>
      <p>The most common form of diabetes, Type 2 occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn't produce enough. It is often linked to lifestyle factors such as obesity, poor diet, and lack of physical activity, but genetics also play a role.</p>
    <li><strong>Gestational Diabetes</strong> </li>
    <p>This type develops during pregnancy and usually goes away after the baby is born. However, it increases the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes later in life for both mother and child.</p>
    
  </ol>

  <h2>Causes and Risk Factors</h2>
  <p>While the exact causes vary by type, several factors increase the risk of diabetes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Family history of diabetes</li>
    <li>Being overweight or obese</li>
    <li>Physical inactivity</li>
    <li>Unhealthy diet (high in sugar and refined carbs)</li>
    <li>High blood pressure or cholesterol</li>
    <li>Age (risk increases after 45)</li>
    <li>Gestational diabetes or giving birth to a large baby</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common Symptoms of Diabetes</h2>
  <p>Symptoms can develop gradually and may be subtle, especially in Type 2 diabetes. Common signs include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Frequent urination</li>
    <li>Excessive thirst</li>
    <li>Unexplained weight loss</li>
    <li>Tingling or numbness in hands or feet</li>
    <li>Slow healing of wounds</li>
    <li>Blurred vision</li>
     <li>Extreme fatigue</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Complications of Untreated Diabetes</h2>
  <p>If left unmanaged, diabetes can lead to serious health complications, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Heart disease and stroke</li>
    <li>Kidney damage</li>
    <li>Vision loss or blindness</li>
    <li>Nerve damage (neuropathy)</li>
    <li>Foot problems, potentially leading to amputation</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Managing and Preventing Diabetes</h2>
