                Insomnia is one of the most common sleep disorders affecting millions of people worldwide. It is characterized by difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up too early and not being able to go back to sleep. Chronic insomnia can lead to significant distress, fatigue, and reduced quality of life.
            </p>

            <h3>What Is Insomnia?</h3>
            <p>Insomnia isn’t just about getting fewer hours of sleep. It’s about not feeling rested even after a full night in bed. You might:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Wake up frequently during the night</li>
                <li>Have trouble falling asleep</li>
                <li>Wake up too early and not be able to go back to sleep</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If this happens occasionally, it’s acute insomnia — usually triggered by stress or life changes. But if it happens at least three times a week for three months or more, it’s chronic insomnia.

            </p>

            <h3>What Causes Insomnia?</h3>
            <p>There’s no single cause. In fact, insomnia is often the result of several factors. Here are the most common ones:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Stress & anxiety – Worry keeps your mind buzzing at night.</li>

                <li>Depression: Mental health and sleep are deeply connected.</li>

                <li>Poor sleep habits: Late-night phone scrolling, caffeine, irregular bedtimes.</li>

                <li>Medical conditions: Chronic pain, asthma, or even certain medications.</li>

                <li>Lifestyle factors: Shift work, lack of exercise, smoking, or alcohol use.</li>
                   
            </ul>
            <h3>Consequences of Insomnia</h3>
            <p>Insomnia doesn’t just make you tired — it can seriously affect your physical and mental health.</p>
            <ul>
               <li>Foggy memory and poor concentration</li>

               <li>Mood swings, anxiety, or depression</li>

               <li>Weakened immune system</li>

               <li>Higher risk of heart disease, obesity, and diabetes</li>

               <li>Accidents at work or while driving</li>
                
            </ul>

            <h3>How Is Insomnia Diagnosed?</h3>

           
         <p>Doctors usually start by asking about your sleep habits and medical history. You might be asked to keep a sleep diary for a few weeks. In some cases, a sleep study might be needed to rule out other conditions like sleep apnea.</p>

         <h3>Overcoming Insomnia</h3>

         <p>Now for the good news: Insomnia is treatable. With the right tools and habits, you can reset your sleep routine.</p>
        
        <ol>
          <li><strong> Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I)</strong></li>
          <p>This is the gold standard treatment. CBT-I helps change negative thoughts and behaviors that disrupt your sleep.</p>
          <li><strong>Medication (Short-Term Only)</strong></li>
          <p>Sleeping pills or melatonin might help in the short run, but they’re not a long-term fix. Always use under medical supervision.</p>
          <li><strong>Healthy Sleep Habits</strong></li>
            <ul>
              <li>Go to bed and wake up at the same time daily</li>
              <li>Limit caffeine and alcohol</li>
              <li>Turn off screens an hour before bed</li>
              <li>Keep your bedroom cool, dark, and quiet</li>
              <li>Avoid heavy meals or exercise right before bed</li>
            </ul>
         <li><strong>Relaxation Techniques</strong></li>
         <p>Try deep breathing, meditation, or progressive muscle relaxation. Even a warm bath before bed can do wonders.
         </p>
        </ol>

         <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
            <p>
                Insomnia can feel overwhelming, but you don’t have to live with it forever. By making a few changes and seeking the right support, you can get back to sleeping soundly — and living fully.
