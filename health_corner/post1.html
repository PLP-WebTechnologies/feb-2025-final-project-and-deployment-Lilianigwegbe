             <h2>What is Dehydration?</h2>
            <p class="post-date">Published: [11/05/2025]</p> <img src="images/dehydration.jpg" alt="A man drinking water" style="width: 40%; max-height: 400px; object-fit: cover; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
            <p> Dehydration occurs when your body loses more fluids than it takes in, leading to insufficient water to carry out normal bodily functions. All ages can be affected, but young children, the elderly, those who are physically active, and those who are exposed to heat are particularly susceptible. It can range in severity from mild to severe.
  </p>

  <h2>Causes of Dehydration</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Insufficient water intake</li>
    <li>Excessive sweating (e.g., from exercise or heat)</li>
    <li>Excessive urination (e.g., from diabetes or diuretics)</li>
    <li>Diarrhea or vomiting</li>
    <li>Fever</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Symptoms</h2>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
